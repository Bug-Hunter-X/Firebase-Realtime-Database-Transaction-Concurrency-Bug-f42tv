# Firebase Realtime Database Transaction Concurrency Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to concurrency issues when using Firebase Realtime Database transactions.  The problem arises when performing updates within a transaction that rely on the current value of a data node, but another client modifies that node before the transaction's callback function executes.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to increment a counter using a database transaction.  However, if multiple clients execute this code simultaneously, the transaction might fail due to race conditions, leading to incorrect counter values or unexpected transaction failures.  The `transaction` method does not guarantee immediate execution of the callback, creating a window of vulnerability to concurrent changes.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows a corrected approach.  It uses a retry mechanism to handle potential concurrency conflicts. If the transaction fails, it retries the operation after a short delay.  This robust strategy addresses the race condition and ensures data consistency.

## Setup

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install the Firebase JavaScript SDK: `npm install firebase`
3.  Configure your Firebase project and set up authentication credentials. Refer to the Firebase documentation for instructions.
4.  Run either `bug.js` or `bugSolution.js` to reproduce and resolve the issue.
