The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase when dealing with Realtime Database transactions.  The issue arises when attempting to update a value based on its current state within a transaction, but the transaction fails due to a concurrency issue.  The `transaction` method's callback function isn't guaranteed to run immediately, and another client might modify the data before the callback executes, leading to unexpected behavior. 
```javascript
const ref = firebase.database().ref('counter');
ref.transaction(currentVal => {
  if (currentVal === null) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return currentVal + 1;
  } 
}).then(() => {
  console.log('Transaction successful');
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Transaction failed:', error);
});
```
